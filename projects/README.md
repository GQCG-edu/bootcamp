To showcase your new skills, you are encouraged to complete the three projects below in order while using as many of the techniques you have learned as possible. This entails:
- forking the repo
- making issues for each of the projects
- closing each issue with a PR
- writing a final LaTeX report in the forked repo
- contributing back to the bootcamp by mentioning issues with the current version of the bootcamp (or even writing PRs that resolve them!)

These projects are based on those provided by Daniel Crawford's group's [Programming Projects](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects) <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>. 

1. [Molecular geometry](projects/molecular_geometry/README.md)
2. [Harmonic vibrational analysis](projects/harmonic_vibrational_analysis/README.md)
3. [Restricted Hartree-Fock](projects/restricted_hartree_fock/README.md)

<a name="footnote1">[1]</a> In our capstone project, the focus is on using basic scientific _Python_, but if you are interested in basic scientific C, then Crawford's projects provide an excellent introduction.
