After the training, you can showcase your skills by engaging in the following three projects which are based on those provided by Daniel Crawford's group's [Programming Projects](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects) <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>. 

1. [Molecular geometry](molecular-geometry)
2. [Harmonic vibrational analysis](harmonic-vibrational-analysis)
3. [Restricted Hartree-Fock](restricted-hartree-fock)

Use as many of the techniques you have learned as possible. This entails:
- forking the repo
- making issues for each of the projects
- closing each issue with a PR
- writing a final LaTeX report in the forked repo
- contributing back to the bootcamp by mentioning issues with the current version of the bootcamp (or even writing PRs that resolve them!)

<a name="footnote1">[1]</a> In our capstone project, the focus is on using basic scientific _Python_, but if you are interested in basic scientific C, then Crawford's projects provide an excellent introduction.
