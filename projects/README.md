## Capstone project: basic quantum chemical programming

As a capstone project, you are encouraged to complete the three projects below in order and discuss your progress with current members of GQCG. They are based on Daniel Crawford's group's [Programming Projects](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects). In our capstone project, the focus is on using basic scientific _Python_, but if you are interested in basic scientific C, then Crawford's projects provide an excellent introduction.
