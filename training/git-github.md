Git is a state-of-the-art version control system and using Git with [Github](https://www.github.com) allows for efficient workflows. To see what Git is all about, check out the [Git lectures](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice). One of the workflows used at GQCG is the [Git flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).
