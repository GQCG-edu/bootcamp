### Scientific Python

[Python](https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/python-crash-course.html) is a great language for learning general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax. You can run a local [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by starting your own Jupyter server from the terminal

```bash
    jupyter notebook
```
Read the [SciPy Lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org) to learn about numerical programming in Python. If needed, look at the courses offered on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) for interactive tutorials. You can get three months of free access if you get the [Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Check out the free compute infrastructure offered by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and/or [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com).
