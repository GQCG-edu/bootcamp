# Training

In this training we will first focussing on acquiring high-level skills using freely available resources that run in your browser (Software as a Service). After you have obtained these skills, we will break free from the confines of this resources and transition to a much more powerful Platform as a Service. At the end of this training, you will be able run scientific simulations on highly powerful supercomputers.

### Managing your progress and getting help with Github

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Implement the [GitHub Hello World project](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Learn how you can [contribute back by opening and closing issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), how you can [socialize](https://guides.github.com/activities/socialize/) and how you can [write in GitHub markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 

> Assignment: study the `bootcamp` repository. Is there something you would like to improve? Open an issue and, if you are up for it, propose to resolve the issues by opening a PR and assigning one of the members of GQCG as a reviewer.

### Scientific communication with LaTeX with Overleaf

LaTeX allows you to easily typeset documents that contain a lot of mathematics. In order to use LaTeX, you first need to study the [structure and syntax of LaTeX documents](http://latex.ugent.be/cursus.php). You can write and typeset LaTeX documents in your browser using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). 

> Assignment: open an issue in the `bootcamp` repo with a title `$username: LaTeX progress` (substitute your username in `$username`) in which you upload a *.pdf file that contains your name, the typeset [time-dependent Schrödinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation) and [an image of Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#/media/File:Erwin_Schrodinger2.jpg). Mention a team member of GQCG, who will review and close the issue.

### Data Science with Python and Google Colab

Google Colab allows you to write and execute Python in your browser. The following [iPython notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) will show you how this is done.

The best way to learn scientific Python is to look at the courses offered on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) for interactive tutorials. You can get three months of free access if you get the [Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). The [SciPy Lectures](http://www.scipy-lectures.org) provide an overview of what you will learn.

> Assignment: open an issue in the `bootcamp` repo with a title `$username: Python Colab progress` in which you upload a iPython notebook in which you 
> - try to diagonalize a random 40 by 40 matrix and a random symmetric 40 by 40 matrix. 
> - reproduce the following image:

> Mention a team member of GQCG, who will review and close the issue.

### Getting in command with the VSCode editor

The [VSCode editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a highly powerful and customizable cross-platform editor. After you have [gotten started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), take a look at the so-called `terminal`. This [terminal](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) gives you more power to do more tasks more quickly with your computer. On Windows, you will need to point to the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) to follow these lessons.

> Assignment: using the terminal, look at the content of your directories. Create, copy and delete a file. Open an issue on GitHub and copy your commands in that issue. 
> Mention a team member of GQCG, who will review and close the issue.

### Enhanced collaboration with version control and Git

Git is a state-of-the-art version control system and using Git with [Github](https://www.github.com) allows for efficient workflows. To see what Git is all about, check out the [Git lectures](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice). VSCode has [builtin Git support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol).

> Assignment: Fork the `bootcamp` repo and pull your personal fork repo to your local machine. Add your name to the `WALL_OF_FAME` file in a draft PR to the the original `bootcamp` repo. Once you have finished the bootcamp, mark the PR as `ready for review` and assign a team member of GQCG, who will review and close the PR.

### Installing software with environment and Docker

- Install Docker
- VSCode extension
- Run jupyter notebook in VSCode

### Enhanced scientific communication with LaTeX workshop

bibtex

### Enhanced data science with Python and Jupyter notebooks


You can run a local [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by starting your own Jupyter server from the terminal

```bash
    jupyter notebook
```

### Scaling up your research with remote development and the UGent HPC
