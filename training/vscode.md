### Code editors

The current preferred general editor at GQCG is the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We also have experience with the [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html), and (Apple's Xcode)[https://developer.apple.com/xcode/].

## Handy packages
