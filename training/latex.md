### LaTeX

LaTeX allows you to easily typeset documents that contain a lot of mathematics. After following the notes on [LaTeX](http://latex.ugent.be/cursus.php), we can collaborate realtime on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) or through commits to a Git repo. For the latter case, [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/) is installed in the gqcg virtual environment.
