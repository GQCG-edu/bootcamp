In this boot camp you will learn the minimal set of computer skills that are required to survive in our computational chemistry group. We will first focussing on acquiring high-level skills using freely available resources that run in your browser. After you have obtained these skills, we will break free from the confines of those resources and transition running software on your local system. Finally, we will transition to highly powerful supercomputers so that you can access and use the resources needed for modern computational research.
