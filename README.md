In this boot camp you will learn the minimal set of computer skills that are required to survive in a computational chemistry group. After working through the [training material](training/README.md) you can showcase your new skills in the [capstone projects](projects/README.md). After the bootcamp, you will have a chance to add your name to the [bootcamp wall of fame](WALL_OF_FAME.md).
