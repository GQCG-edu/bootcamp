In this boot camp you will learn the minimal set of computer skills that are required to survive in our computational chemistry group. We will first focussing on acquiring high-level skills using freely available resources that run in your browser. After you have obtained these skills, we will break free from the confines of those resources and transition running software on your local system. Finally, you will apply the skills you have learned by implementing Restricted Hartree-Fock using PSI4.
