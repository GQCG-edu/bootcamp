The $s$ shell, with angular momentum $\\lambda = 0$ has one component usually designated as $s$. The $p$ shell ($\\lambda = 1$) has three components, designated as $p_x, p_y, p_z$.

    "We represent a single component (an **atomic orbital**) by a linear combination of Gaussians ($c_1 \\phi_1 + c_2 \\phi_2 + c_3 \\phi_3 ...$) hereon referred to as **primitives**. For example, the STO-3G basis set uses three primitives for each atomic orbital basis function. Each primitive is weighted by a coefficient $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our angular momentum index vector $\\mathbf{n}$ we denote the single component of the $s$ shell to have angular momentum index $\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0} = (0, 0, 0)$. Since the $p$ shell has three components, we may compactly express the angular momentum index vector as $\\mathbf{1}_i$ where $i$ may be $x$, $y$, or $z$, and $\\mathbf{1}_i = (\\delta_{ix}, \\delta_{iy}, \\delta_{iz})$. For example, $p_x$ may be represented as $\\mathbf{1}_x = (1, 0, 0)$. For the six components of the $d$ shell, we require a sum of two angular momentum index vectors $\\mathbf{1}_i + \\mathbf{1}_j$, where $(i,j = x,y,z)$. In this notation, the $d_{xy}$ component is $\\mathbf{1}_x + \\mathbf{1}_y = (1,0,0) + (0,1,0) = (1,1,0)$. To obtain higher order angular momentum components, we add the appropriate number of $\\mathbf{1}_i$'s ($\\mathbf{n}$'s)."
