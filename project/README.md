[PySCF](https://pyscf.org/index.html) is an ab initio computational chemistry package that allows users access to many internal objects needed for quantum chemical method development. In this capstone project, you will implement [Restricted Hartree-Fock](rhf.ipynb) using the objects offered by PySCF. If you need to refresh your understanding of the Hartree-Fock methodology, review this [TMP Chem Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3D_WZ3NbbM&list=PLm8ZSArAXicIijiVIx0yfk2ZOK-16ycji).

> Note: use as many of the techniques you have learned as possible. This entails but is not limited to
> - writing a final LaTeX report on your implementation in your forked repo
> - contributing back to the bootcamp by mentioning issues with the current version of the bootcamp (or even writing PRs that resolve them!)
