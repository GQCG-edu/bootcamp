[Psi4](https://psicode.org/) is an ab initio computational chemistry package that allows users access to many internal objects needed for quantum chemical method development. In this module you will learn the basics of interacting directly with the class structure and functionality of the Psi4 program via the Python interface. Each of the following tutorials introduces particular Psi4 class objects and/or specific NumPy functionality, all of which you will have to use to implement Restricted Hartree-Fock

1. [Getting started: the Psi4 API and basic options](getting-started.ipynb)
2. [Molecule: building molecules, geometry specification, and returning molecular properties](molecule.ipynb)
3. [Psi4-NumPy interfacing: Psi4 and NumPy data exchange](psi4-numpy.ipynb)
4. [Wavefunction: building and passing wavefunction objects, and returning wavefunction properties](wavefunction.ipynb)
5. [Mints: generating 1- and 2-electron integrals](mints-helper.ipynb)
6. [Tensor manipulation: basics](tensors.ipynb)

As a capstone project, you will implement [Restricted Hartree-Fock](rhf.ipynb). Use as many of the techniques you have learned as possible. This entails but is not limited to
- writing a final LaTeX report on your implementation in your forked repo
- contributing back to the bootcamp by mentioning issues with the current version of the bootcamp (or even writing PRs that resolve them!)
